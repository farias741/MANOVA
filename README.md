# MANOVA

In multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), more than one dependent variable is evaluated simultaneously. Where MANOVA allows us to look at the data in a multivariate way, it can be a tool with greater power to detect some effects, moreover, as we do a single test, this decreases the chance of making type I errors (H0 is rejected when in reality it is true). For the analyses, some libraries (packages) available in the *R software* were used. The database contains information from the example of MANOVA using data from Tstsuoka, 1988, p. 274.
